## [Unreleased]

## [5.0.2] - 2020-04-13

### Fixed

* Install `Typescript` as a prod dependency so installs which only have `Typescript` as dev dependency and prune non-prod dependencies can still execute their `Typescript` bots.

## [5.0.1] - 2020-04-12

### Fixed

* The message dispatcher was resetting the `inFlighRequest` when a notification was received

## [5.0.0] - 2020-04-12

### Changed

* Bump the protocol version to `2.1.2`

### Added

* The `tickNotification` handler takes now an object as a second argument. This object has an `inFlightRequest` property which is set to the last sent but not responded request or `undefined`
* `deployMineRequest` a new request helper to deploy mines

## [4.1.1] - 2020-04-08
